A comprehensive collection of examples, notebooks, and tutorials demonstrating how to build applications with LangChain and various generative AI models.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains a structured learning path for understanding and implementing various LangChain features and components. From basic language models to complex agent architectures, this collection provides practical code examples that showcase the full LangChain ecosystem.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modules that follow a logical progression from basic to advanced LangChain concepts:

### Foundation Components
- **01Langchain_models**: Working with different language models (LLMs, Chat Models, Embedding Models)
- **02Langchain_prompts**: Prompt engineering techniques and templates
- **03langchain-structured-output**: Getting structured responses from LLMs using TypedDict, Pydantic, etc.
- **04langchain-output-parsers**: Different methods to parse and structure LLM outputs

### Core Processing Flows
- **05langchain-chains**: Building sequential, parallel, and conditional chains
- **06langchain-runnables**: Modern approach to composable LangChain workflows
- **07langchain-document-loaders**: Loading documents from various sources (text, PDF, web)
- **08langchain-text-splitters**: Different techniques for chunking documents

### Advanced Retrieval & Generation
- **09langchain-vector-stores**: Working with vector databases (Chroma)
- **10langchain-retrievers**: Implementing various retrieval strategies
- **11langchain-retrieval-augmented-generation**: Building RAG applications
- **12langchain-tools**: Using and creating tools for LLM augmentation
- **13langchain-tool-calling**: Advanced tool usage with function calling
- **14langchain-agents**: Building autonomous agents with reasoning capabilities

## üìö Learning Path

For those new to LangChain, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with **01Langchain_models** to understand basic model interactions
2. Move to **02Langchain_prompts** to learn prompt engineering techniques
3. Explore **05langchain-chains** and **06langchain-runnables** for composition patterns
4. Progress through document loaders and text splitters (07-08)
5. Learn about vector stores and retrievers (09-10)
6. Build a RAG application with **11langchain-retrieval-augmented-generation**
7. Finally, advance to tools and agents (12-14)
