And so in the case of CUDA is very\\xa0\\nmuch this the same way and probably the first external ideas of using our GPUs for parallel\\xa0\\nprocessing emerged out of some interesting work in medical imaging a couple of researchers\\xa0\\nat Mass General were using it to do CT reconstruction. They were using our graphics\\xa0\\nprocessors for that reason and it inspired us.

We\\xa0\\nasked ourselves, if it can do this, how far can it go? How do we get from the robots that\\xa0\\nwe have now to the future world that you see? Cleo, everything that moves will be\\xa0\\nrobotic someday and it will be soon. We invested tens of billions of dollars before\\xa0\\nit really happened. No that\\'s very good, you did some research! But the big breakthrough\\xa0\\nI would say is when we... That\\'s Jensen Huang, and whether you know it or not\\nhis decisions are\\xa0shaping your future. He\\'s the CEO of NVIDIA, the company that skyrocketed over the past few\\nyears\\xa0to become one of the most valuable companies in the world because they led a fundamental shift\\xa0\\nin how computers work unleashing this current explosion of what\\'s possible with technology.\\xa0\\n\"NVIDIA\\'s done it again!\" We found ourselves being one of the most important technology companies in\\n\\nthe limits and so we discover the limits together. Now we do the same thing in system engineering and\\xa0\\ncooling systems. It turns out plumbing is really important to us because of liquid cooling.\\xa0\\nAnd maybe fans are really important to us because of air cooling and we\\'re trying to design\\xa0\\nthese fans in a way almost like you know they\\'re aerodynamically sound so that we could pass the\\xa0\\nhighest volume of air, make the least amount of noise. So we have aerodynamics engineers in our\\ncompany. And so even though even though we don\\'t make \\'em, we design them and we have to deep\\xa0\\nexpertise of knowing how to have them made. And and from that we try to push the\\xa0\\nlimits. One of the themes of this conversation is that you are a person who makes big bets on the\\xa0\\nfuture and time and time again you\\'ve been right about those bets. We\\'ve talked about GPUs, we\\'ve\\xa0\\ntalked about CUDA, we\\'ve talked about bets you\\'ve made in AI - self-driving cars, and we\\'re going to\\n\\ntalked about CUDA, we\\'ve talked about bets you\\'ve made in AI - self-driving cars, and we\\'re going to\\xa0\\nbe right on robotics and - this is my question. What are the bets you\\'re making now? the latest bet we\\njust described at the CES and I\\'m very very proud of it and I\\'m very excited about it is the\\xa0\\nfusion of Omniverse and Cosmos so that we have this new type of generative world generation\\xa0\\nsystem, this multiverse generation system. I think that\\'s going to be profoundly important in\\xa0\\nthe future of robotics and physical systems. Of course the work that we\\'re doing with human\\xa0\\nrobots, developing the tooling systems and the training systems and the human demonstration\\xa0\\nsystems and all of this stuff that that you\\'ve already mentioned, we\\'re just seeing the\\xa0\\nbeginnings of that work and I think the next 5 years are going to be very interesting in\\xa0\\nthe world of human robotics. Of course the work that we\\'re doing in digital biology so that\\n\\nin that by building CUDA and then CUDA and the use of GPUs allows for a a step change in neural\\xa0\\nnetworks and machine learning and begins a sort of revolution that we\\'re now seeing only\\xa0\\nincrease in importance today... All of a sudden computer vision is solved. All of a sudden speech\\xa0\\nrecognition is solved. All of a sudden language understanding is solved. These incredible\\xa0\\nproblems associated with intelligence one by one by one by one where we had no solutions\\xa0\\nfor in past, desperate desire to have solutions for, all of a sudden one after another get solved\\xa0\\nyou know every couple of years. It\\'s incredible. Yeah so you\\'re seeing that, in 2012 you\\'re\\xa0\\nlooking ahead and believing that that\\'s the future that you\\'re going to be living in now,\\xa0\\nand you\\'re making bets that get you there, really big bets that have very high stakes. And then my\\xa0\\nperception as a lay person is that it takes a pretty long time to get there. You make these bets -',\n",
